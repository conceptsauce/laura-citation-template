# Citation Template in MS Word for Mendeley and Zotero using CSL

Using the CSL template is easy, just import it via the URL into Mendeley or Zotero, At the time of writing this, Mendeley has big problems in processing large documents, if you are using Mendeley for more than 100 pages, then better split the document, otherwise Mendeley has the happed of dying or taking 10 minutes to insert 1 citation. Be warned ;)
